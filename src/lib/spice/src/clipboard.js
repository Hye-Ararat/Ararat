**  resize.js
**      This bit of Javascript is a set of logic to help with window
**  resizing, using the agent channel to request screen resizes.
**
**  It's a bit tricky, as we want to wait for resizing to settle down
**  before sending a size.  Further, while horizontal resizing to use the whole
**  browser width is fairly easy to arrange with css, resizing an element to use
**  the whole vertical space (or to force a middle div to consume the bulk of the browser
**  window size) is tricky, and the consensus seems to be that Javascript is
**  the only right way to do it.
