# Hye Ararat

Ararat is the next-generation **container/virtual machine control panel**. It is **your one-stop shop for single application container, full system containers, and KVM instances**.

Ararat is **built on top of the incredible LXD platform**, making it **compatible with the same pre-made images available for a wide number of Linux distrubutions that LXD is**.

Ararat also includes an incredibly powerful but simple REST API.
